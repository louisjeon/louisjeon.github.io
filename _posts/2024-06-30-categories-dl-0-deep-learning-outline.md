## Difference between traditional ML and Deep Learning
- Features are extracted using human intuition in traditional ML
- Feature extraction is parameterized and handled by a model in deep learning
- Relatively larger number of parameters are used in deep learning

## Why deep learning?
- Various methods and modeling, big datasets are made for better feature extraction
  - Large Dataset
  - Self-supervised Learning
    - Pretrained Model
